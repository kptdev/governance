# Governance of the kpt project

This repository contains information about how the kpt project is governed. 

## Governance

All repos of kpt, the repos under the [kptdev](https://github.com/kptdev/) organisation, are under the governance
described here. 
Every repo has two code owners defined in the CODEOWNERS file of the repo. All prs should be approved by both code
owners and the code owners should not be from the same company.
Any contributor who contributes at least 10% of the code in a release can become a code owner if they wish to and do not
work for a company already represented as code owner. Even if the number of code owners is higher than 2 only 2
approvals are needed to merge a pr.
