# Security Policy for the kpt organisation

We're extremely grateful for users and security researchers that report vulnerabilities to the kpt open source
community. 
All reports are thoroughly investigated by a set of community volunteers.

The kpt community has adopted the security disclosures and response policy below to respond to security issues.

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

## Supported Versions

The kpt community has *n - 1* version support policy for all artefacts released.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### When should you?

- You think you discovered a potential security vulnerability in kpt.
- You are unsure how a vulnerability affects kpt.
- You think you discovered a vulnerability in a dependency of kpt. For those projects, please leverage their reporting
  policy.

### When you should not?

- You need assistance in configuring kpt for security - please discuss this on one of the
  [kpt communication channels](https://kpt.dev/#communication).
- You need help applying security related updates.
- Your issue is not security related.

### Please use the process below to report a vulnerability the repositories in the kpt organization

Vulnerabilities reported as new security advisory to the repository affected by the vulnerability.

| Repository | Advisory Reporting |
|------------|--------------------|
| kpt | [In the kpt repository](https://github.com/kptdev/kpt/security/advisories/) |
| porch | [In the porch repository](https://github.com/kptdev/porch/security/advisories/) |
| krm-functions-catalog | [In the krm-functions-catalog repository](https://github.com/kptdev/krm-functions-catalog/security/advisories/) |
| krm-functions-sdk | [In the krm-functions-sdk repository](https://github.com/kptdev/krm-functions-sdk/security/advisories/) |
| kpt-samples | [In the kpt-samples repository](https://github.com/kptdev/kpt-samples/security/advisories/) |
| kpt-backstage-plugins | [In the kpt-backstage-plugins repository](https://github.com/kptdev/kpt-backstage-plugins/security/advisories) |
| governance | [In the governance repository](https://github.com/kptdev/governance/security/advisories/) |
| .github | [In the .github repository](https://github.com/kptdev/.github/security/advisories) |
| .project | [In the .project repository](https://github.com/kptdev/.project/security/advisories) |


1. Open the new Security Advisory 

    * Please include the information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature
      and scope of the possible issue:

        * Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
        * Versions of all components (kpt, porch, KRM functions)
        * Full paths of the source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
        * Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL) 
        * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
        * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
        * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
        * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue
        * Mark if the vulnerability is actively exploited

    * This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

2. The project security team will send an initial response to the disclosure in 3-5 days. Once the vulnerability and fix
   are confirmed, the team will plan to release the fix based on the severity and complexity.

3. You may be contacted by a project maintainer to further discuss the reported item. Please bear with us as we seek to
   understand the breadth and scope of the reported problem, recreate it, and confirm if there is a vulnerability
   present.

## Public Disclosure Timing

A public disclosure date is negotiated by the kpt project maintainers and the bug submitter. We prefer to fully disclose
the bug as soon as possible once a user mitigation is available. It is reasonable to delay disclosure when the bug or
the fix is not yet fully understood, the solution is not well-tested, or for vendor coordination. The timeframe for
disclosure is from immediate (especially if it's already publicly known) to a few weeks. For a vulnerability with a
straightforward mitigation, we expect report date to disclosure date to be on the order of 7 days. The kpt project
maintainer team holds the final say when setting a disclosure date.
